### 1.Installations

All that is required for this project is any Python compiler. After importing the OpenCV library, you can start working.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2.Project Motivation

This study was carried out to build a system that finds whether there are scratches on the car from the camera images at the last checkpoint on the car production line. You can also review the document showing the latest version of the system we have developed.

### 3.File Descriptions

 * Data File: You can find the sample images I used while running the Python codes in this folder.
 * Python Files: They are python files that I have tried many functions of the OpenCV library.
 * Project Documentations: It is the document of the car scratch finder project.

### 4.How to Interact with your project

These files contain the functions I use to find scratches on the car with the OpenCV library. If you are developing similar projects, you can find the appropriate function by trying the codes in the files.
